# spell-now
SpellNow! is an engaging game that allows students to enforce their vocabulary and spelling by practing their English in a spelling bee-like environment. The game features interactive components, real-time feedback, and exciting visuals that aid students in getting excited to learn the English vocabulary.

# What I Learned
* Creating a GUI for a game must be user-centric. I had to take the target audience and needs of the user into account in order for the experience to be engaging. 
* Transferring data between screens needs to be done in an efficient and clean manner using data structures. Otherwise, data will get lost and debugging will be difficult.
* A database culminating thousands of spelling bee-like words doesn't exist yet. Why? One of my goals for this project is to create such a database and allow it to be publicly available for open use.

# To-dos
* Instead of typing responses, add voice recognition functionality that allows users to spell the word orally
* Convert into a web application that users can directly access
* Use web scraping to build a larger database of words that can be accessed for the game and allow the database to be publicly available; there is currently no such database that exists for spelling bee words specifically, so those included in the game are the most common words tested in the national Scripps Spelling Bee.
