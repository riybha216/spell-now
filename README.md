# Demo

# To-dos
* Instead of typing responses, add voice recognition functionality that allows users to spell the word orally
* Convert into a web application that users can directly access
* Use web scraping to build a larger database of words that can be accessed for the game and allow the database to be publicly available; there is currently no such database that exists for spelling bee words specifically, so those included in the game are the most common words tested in the national Scripps Spelling Bee.
